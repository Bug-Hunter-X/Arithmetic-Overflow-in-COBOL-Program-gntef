This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: arithmetic overflow. The program reads customer data and calculates the total balance.  An error occurs when the sum of customer balances exceeds the maximum value allowed by the data type. The solution provides a more robust approach that handles overflow gracefully.
